# Bow-String Simulation in the Audio and Haptic Domain
Author: Jack Kilgore


## Instructions to Run
This repo is designed to run within the chai3D source repository in a folder: `/path_to_chai3d/sketches/this_repo`.

Once correctly placed, open the xcode project and click run. This will produce an executable running a haptic simulation of a bow-string instrument.

To run the audio simulation open `./max/mono_string.maxpat` in Max.
